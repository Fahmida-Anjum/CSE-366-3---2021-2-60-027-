Leaf Disease Classification using Transfer Learning
Introduction
In this project, I'm tackling the challenge of identifying leaf diseases using deep learning. I'm using pre-trained models, which are like expert networks already trained on a huge dataset.

Data Preprocessing
First, I get the dataset ready. I split it into two parts: one for training and one for validation. Then, I resize all images to make them easier to work with, and I adjust the pixel values so the computer can understand them better.

Model Architecture
DenseNet121
I start with a model called DenseNet121. It's known for its ability to learn from data very well. I remove the part that guesses what an image is and add new layers that help it understand our specific problem: identifying leaf diseases.

EfficientNetB0
Next, I try another model called EfficientNetB0. It's famous for being really good at learning from images efficiently. Like before, I tweak it to understand our leaf disease problem better.

Training Process
I teach both models what leaf diseases look like using the training data. I do this in small batches, like teaching in small groups, to make it easier for them to learn. After each round of teaching (which we call an epoch), I check how well they're doing with the validation data.

Evaluation Metrics and Results
Once the training is done, I test both models on new data to see how well they can identify leaf diseases. I look at two main things: how often they're right (accuracy) and how close they are when they're wrong (loss). I also make some graphs to see if they got better over time or if they had trouble learning.

Discussion
Looking at the results, I see how each model did. I can also spot any patterns, like if one model learned faster than the other or if they both struggled with certain types of diseases.

Conclusion and Future Work
In the end, I've shown how pre-trained models can be used to solve the leaf disease classification problem. But there's still more to explore. Maybe trying different pre-trained models or tweaking some settings could improve the results even more.
